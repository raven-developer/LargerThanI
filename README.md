## Information
This website's sole purpose was to test my skills on building a simple website using HTML and CSS. While building, I tried to incorporate Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) as my CSS pre-processor.

I used this [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/proto/OCamciBU3vMVYKdGPWVpES/NGO-Web-Design---Desktop-only-(Community)-(Copy)?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-744&p=f&viewport=1012%2C8527%2C0.65&t=ul2qHGYXREfM1WKh-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed) that I found on Figma Community and made some design adjustments.

_This is also a single-page website at the moment. While I work on improving my own skills..._
